## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This was my first challenge where I used CSS Grid. Over the past week I have completed two LinkedIn Learning courses that taught how to use CSS Grid and FlexBox. 

I really enjoy using CSS Grid. It is a great tool for determining layout of the page or component. 

The two CSS Grid courses I completed were:

- [CSS: Advanced Layouts with Grid](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/css-advanced-layouts-with-grid)
- [CSS: Combining Grid and Flexbox](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/css-combining-grid-and-flexbox)


### Continued development

- Continue developing CSS Grid and FlexBox skills
- Start implementing SASS
- I'm currently building my JavaScript skills and working towards attempting Front End Mentor challenges utilising JS.
